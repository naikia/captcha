# FurryID Captcha's made insane.

I hate captcha's and I made it harder to captcha.

This is dead ass a proper captcha solution that you can use idrc.

It's siomon says with audios made in JS and CSS that displays using PHP.

# How to deploy

Add the files in your scripts, styles, and components (or how ever you format your site).


Then edit 
```
window.location.href = '/getfurryid';
```
on line 185 to be where ever you want it to go (or edit it so people cant go to /yourpage in the Future)

And its done
